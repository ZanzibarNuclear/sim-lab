# sim-lab

A place to experiment with simulations. Our primary objective is to create science-based
simulations related to power generation. We should start with some basics and build up to complex system.

At the same time, this is a good chance to compare the capabilities and performance of software languages: Go, Python, and Rust. Simply put, Go was built for IT operations, Python has strong libraries for science and analytics, and Rust is supposed to be "fast and stable" at processing.

Let's learn as we go.
